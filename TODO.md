# TO DO

## In Progress/Next Up
- [ ] Configure colors
- [ ] Add Firefox, Safari, and Arc to quickly open bookmarks as well, although these won't have profiles.

## Bugs/improvements
- [ ] Add examples/docs for initial setup

## Refactors
- [ ] Reuse SelectBox component for Search list
- [ ] Check for conditions in the code, and my opinion on it...

## Functionality
- [ ] Bookmarks through Temba as it's just "JSON"
- [ ] When choosing a "Fire and forget" item, show a "Please wait..." of 2 or 3 arbitrary seconds before showing search again.
- [ ] Run on start up: https://chatgpt.com/c/6724977d-c048-8010-b213-65fe14bbddec
- [ ] Add keywords to also match an item on
- [ ] Profiles: Add a `profile` array ("work", "private", etc.) to configured items, and also (somehow) to the apps, and then have an option called "Switch profile" with a component reading the unique profile names and let you choose one, or none. Items can be part of multiple profiles, and apps without profiles are always displayed.
